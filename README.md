# RNAseqAuto
 The RNAseqAuto workflow was created to assist epilepsy researchers at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health. This workflow allows users to review data output by the RNA-sequencing analysis pipeline in the form of Galaxy tabular spreadsheets. The workflow allows the user to import data, choose between analysis for gene-level or exon-level data, and calculate the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM).
